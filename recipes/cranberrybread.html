        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of flour. This easy cranberry bread starts with all-purpose flour, which adds structure.</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar. White sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder. Baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt. A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors.</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda. Baking soda act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces and softened. Softened butter adds moisture, flavor, and richness.</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten. A beaten egg acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped cranberries. This recipe calls for chopped, fresh cranberries. You can use dried cranberries if you like.</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped walnuts (Optional). Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome nutty flavor and crunch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8x4-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Stir butter into flour mixture until combined. Add orange juice, orange zest, and egg; mix well.</li>
            <li>Fold in cranberries and walnuts. Spoon batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 75 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
